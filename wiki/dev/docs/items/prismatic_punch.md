## Obtaining
Prismatic Punch can be crafted at an [Altar of The Accursed](../mechanics/altar_of_the_accursed.md) by using a <i class="icon-minecraft icon-minecraft-crossbow"></i>Crossbow, 24 <i class="icon-fsee icon-fsee-pixie-dust"></i>[Pixie Dust](pixie_dust.md) and 6 <i class="icon-minecraft icon-minecraft-diamond"></i>Diamonds. The Crossbow used to craft this weapon will have its special properties *(like enchantments)* removed in process.

## Usage
Upon shooting, Prismatic Punch will transform any Arrow into a powerful Prismatic Blast. They are slow and deccelerate over timespan of 10 seconds until stopping completely. After stopping they will linger in place for about 15 more second until they self-detonate. They also bounce off walls.

Prismatic Blasts gain a huge speed bonus when an enemy is nearby, which they will target and home onto, detonating on contact.
 
Explosions deal varying amounts of damage, between 4:heart::heart: and 10:heart::heart::heart::heart::heart: damage, with a bit of splash damage as well.

Multishot enchantment causes 3 different-colored blasts to be shot in a 70° cone.

## Tips 

- Use regular Arrows with this weapon, since it converts ALL ammo into Blasts. Using Spectral/Tipped Arrows is a waste of ammo.
- Explosions can hurt <u>you</u> if you stand too close to your target. Keep your distance.
- Accuracy is not the most important thing, since Blasts will home on its targets. Be careful though, as Blasts tend to target different mobs than the ones you want!
- Prismatic Blasts do not home onto players in PvP, but they can still hurt them.
- It is better if all three Multishot Blasts hit different targets, as immunity frames effectively prevent them from stacking damage on a single enemy.
- Prismatic Blasts will home on, but not damage the [Ender Dragon](../mobs/bosses/ender_dragon.md) or End Crystals.

## Trivia

- This is first Developer Item to get added into FSEE.
- This is the second Crossbow to get added, first being the [Clockwork Crossbow](clockwork_crossbow.md).
- According to YaGirlGiulles *(artist, who made the textures for this item)*, the color palette is based around trans pride flag[^1].
    - They are also a reference to colors of [Last Prism](https://terraria.wiki.gg/wiki/Last_Prism), a Terraria item.
