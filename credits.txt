FUNCTIONS:

	Hex - https://www.planetminecraft.com/member/hex_-now_loading-/
		Base worldgen and every function in 'far_end' namespace is 99% made by them. 
		I only did small alterations to apply tiny tweaks and changes to base.
		I just fucking love you Hex ❤❤

	Cloud Wolf - https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCZnBqVITQ0dloqUU0fGxY3g
		Code in 'rng' namespace
		And code for homing effect of Prismatic Blasts
		❤

	ICY105 - https://github.com/ICY105
		Custom Durability system
		Player movement detection ('foka.is_moving')
		Honestly, these are all just CTRL + C and 
		CTRL + V from DatapackUtilities (RIP DU)
		𝘊𝘰𝘶𝘭𝘥 𝘫𝘶𝘴𝘵 𝘴𝘸𝘪𝘵𝘤𝘩 𝘵𝘰 𝘚𝘮𝘪𝘵𝘩𝘦𝘥 𝘭𝘪𝘣𝘳𝘢𝘳𝘪𝘦𝘴,

	4P5 - https://www.planetminecraft.com/member/4p5/
		Elytra trails
		I just kindly borrowed the offsets for particles
		for them to align with wings, as I had no idea
		what to offset by how much.
		+ 𝘚𝘢𝘸 𝘵𝘩𝘦 𝘱𝘢𝘤𝘬 𝘢𝘯𝘥 𝘨𝘰𝘵 𝘢𝘯 𝘪𝘥𝘦𝘢 𝘧𝘰𝘳 𝘵𝘩𝘪𝘴 𝘧𝘦𝘢𝘵𝘶𝘳𝘦

	Smithed - https://smithed.dev/
		I know that I just said that Smithed sucks,
		but the custom player damage thing is quite nice, I cannot lie


WORLDGEN:
	
	Hex - https://www.planetminecraft.com/member/hex_-now_loading-/
		Who did you expect here?
		To not include original creator...
		That would be really shameful

	_humanoid - https://www.planetminecraft.com/member/_humanoid/
		Luminous End and Un-Luminous End were an inspiration for me.
	
	Misode - https://github.com/misode
		Their generators (https://misode.github.io/) have helped me a lot with development.
		Especially the Upgrader, which has done like 40% of all tasks for me!
		It didn't do shit from 1.18 to 1.19, but whatever, still thank you
		for these generators, I would literally die without them!

	Starmute - https://www.planetminecraft.com/member/starmute/
		Nullscapes was also a giantic inspiration for more barren biomes.

		𝙉𝙊𝙒 𝙎𝙏𝙊𝙋 𝘼𝙎𝙆𝙄𝙉𝙂 𝙈𝙀 𝙁𝙊𝙍 𝘾𝙊𝙈𝙋𝘼𝙏𝙄𝘽𝙄𝙇𝙄𝙏𝙔 𝘼𝘿𝘿𝙊𝙉.
		Also, the Snow Layers in Frosted Hills are from their pack - Terralith.

	dfsek - https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/authors/dfsek.597832/
		BetterEnd plugin.
		I actually remember using it on my server a while ago.
		And then I started tampering with worldgen myself... ❤
		Needless to say, 95% of new structures added in 1.6
		were made for BetterEnd plugin,
		and I just ported them to Vanilla 1.19 from Spigot 1.16

ADVANCEMENTS:

	Misode - https://github.com/misode
		Yeah, I used Misode's generators to create Advancements as well...
	
	Cavinator1 - https://www.planetminecraft.com/member/cavinator1/
		'BlazeandCave's Advancement Pack' has been an inspiration for
		like actually a lot of the Advancements in this pack.
		You can clearly see it in some places xD (here read: 'Portable Storage')

	RaiderRoss:
		They made like 6 advancements! Not for the pack though,
		but they were kind enough to share these with me <3
		They may now see their family, after 5 months of
		me holding them hostage!




PREDICATES:

	Misode - https://github.com/misode
		At this point you know what I would write there...
		𝘓𝘪𝘴𝘵𝘦𝘯, 𝘐 𝘢𝘮 𝘫𝘶𝘴𝘵 𝘥𝘶𝘮𝘣, 𝘰𝘬𝘢𝘺??

	UltroGhast - https://www.planetminecraft.com/member/ultroghast/
		Their 'Random Choices and Possibilities' Data Pack made creating chance-based
		features way more doable




TRANSLATIONS:

	SAGAーサガ:
		For doing entire Japanese translation
		Now how cool is that? 
		𝘈𝘯𝘪𝘮𝘦 𝘨𝘪𝘳𝘭𝘴 𝘪𝘯 𝘍𝘚𝘌𝘌 𝘸𝘩𝘦𝘯???

OTHER RANDOM 'THANK YOU'S THAT I PROPABLY SHOULDN'T WRITE DOWN, BUT I AM GOING TO ANYWAY AND NOBODY CAN STOP ME:

	Waffle_Wizard_:
		For being.
		Remember that you are not annoying me with your messages,
		it is actually warming to always have someone who can
		give you an opinion on every development-related topic ❤

	bro omg:
		Nice screenshots bro!
		𝘔𝘢𝘺 𝘐 𝘩𝘰𝘭𝘥 𝘵𝘩𝘦𝘮?
	
	IEatPotatoes_:
		:ward:
		And bruh, they made ENTIRE MINECRAFT STYLE TEXT FOR MY PACK
		AND NOT ONLY FOR THIS PACK, FOR EVERY SINGLE ONE OF MY PROJECT
		Like bruh, I can barely draw a stickman in paint...

	Kier:
		For also experimenting with installing my pack on server.
		Believe it or not, but it actually helped me think of
		steps that are both simple and easy to execute.
		And as short as possible.

	PhoenixPlayz:
		For being the first person ever to find the
		Paper installation guide by themself instead
		of asking this damn question ❤❤

	billyp673:
		They designed a whole AFK farm for Void Fishing.
		Just because they saw Diamonds in the Loot Table.
		Now how cool is that?
